\title{Check gene non-zero part distribution}
\usage{
checkdist(gene, n = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{The gene expression matrix you'd like to check}

\item{n}{The num of genes that will be randomly picked, default value is 10}
}
\value{
NONE, a QQ-plot will be shown
}
\description{
The function samples n gene expressions, draw normalized QQ-plot to compare real gene distribution with fitted gene distribution. The function is used for checking whether non-zero part of the data fit negative binomial distribution well.
}
\note{
This function may fail since It's possible that the random picked gene can't be fit to negative bionomial distribution, all zero value for example.
